                                    <span className="text-xl font-bold">Digital Excreta</span> works as a digital landfill. Full of discarded beauty standing strong in a field of decay; exploring the sublime. From Dallas, Texas, they work in various digital mediums with 2D and 3D art. Exploring the infinite possibilities of New Media and watching human ideas manifest themselves through the web, her work expresses the beauty in embracing the chaos life presents and creating something new. Fortitude is a fundamental aspect of true beauty and that beauty is represented with Afro-futuristic expressions. It is all a journey of strength and diligence through the chaotic digital space, accelerating towards a new era.  Her work has been featured in various galleries and magazines around the world physically and digitally.
